### Summary

- Added timeouts and better exception handling when fetching offsets and checking for updates.
- Critical errors now cause an immediate exit rather than letting the program run in an undefined state.
- The bunnyhop loop includes a short sleep when the Spacebar is not pressed, reducing CPU usage.
